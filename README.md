# Green Coder
<br>
A code editor which is made in Sketchware.
 
**Note: it is in it's alpha stages!**

## TODO List
I have more goals but unable to do it because of my abilities but i never give up!

- [ ] Autocompletion codes
- [ ] indication of errors in codes
- [ ] Advanced projects manager

## Resources
As i said in description, I'm making green coder in pure **vannila sketchware v3.10.0**. My only goal is to make advanced Code editor with outdated sketchware!

## Installation
It is recommended to use [latest version](https://github.com/GreenCityLife/Green-Coder/releases). You should only report bugs for latest version.

There is [Coder.apk](bin/coder.apk?raw=true) in bin folder if you want to get latest features before release which is updated after every commit. Download it on your own risk and help finding out bugs to repair them!
