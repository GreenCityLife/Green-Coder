# Green Coder
A coder editor which isn't released yet ðŸ˜…!

## TODO List
I have more goals but unable to do it because of my abilities but i never give up!

- [ ] Autocompletion codes
- [ ] indication of errors in codes
- [ ] Advanced projects manager

## Resources
As i said in description, I'm making green coder in pure **vannila sketchware v3.10.0**. My only goal is to make advanced Code editor with outdated sketchware!

## Installation
Green Coder isn't released yet (even one version), ~~So no way to download~~. 

Wait a minute, There is [Coder.apk](bin/coder.apk) in bin folder. Uh, Apk leaked unfortunately ðŸ˜³ but **i won't recommend downloading it as it may contain bugs**. Download it on your own risk and help finding out bugs to repair them!
